    "title": "Hand Gesture-Based Volume Control System",
    "description": "This project enables users to control their system volume using just hand gestures detected through a webcam. By measuring the distance between the thumb and index finger using MediaPipe's hand landmarks, the system adjusts the volume in real-time. It's an intuitive and touch-free way to manage audio levels using computer vision and hand tracking.",
