        </div>
        <p>this is the first message.<br />
          not from a company.<br />
          not from a pitch deck.<br />
          not from a brochure trying to sell you a vision.<br />
          just from us.</p>

        <p>hi.<br />
          welcome to waffle.</p>

        <p>you&apos;ve probably heard words like "build," "community," "founders," "hackathons," "creators" so many timesâ€¦<br />
          they start to feel like buzzwords.<br />
          they&apos;ve lost meaning.<br />
          overused in events that promised the moon and delivered pizza.<br />
          plastered on every tech club, every brochure, every event.</p>

        <p>but waffle isn&apos;t that.<br />
          waffle isn&apos;t trying to be another startup club, or tech gang, or code cult.<br />
          waffle is something raw.<br />
          real.<br />
          personal.</p>

        <p>waffle isâ€¦ the place i always wished existed.<br />
          a space where you don&apos;t need to be a genius.<br />
          you don&apos;t need to know VC jargon.<br />
          you don&apos;t need a co-founder or an elevator pitch.<br />
          you don&apos;t need to know what the fuck to do with your life.<br />
          you just need one thing:</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ’¥ the urge to try.</strong></p>

        <p>the urge to build a dumb project.<br />
          to write that essay you never submitted.<br />
          to drop that YouTube video even if no one watches.<br />
          to design your first Figma screen even if it&apos;s ugly.<br />
          to code your first page even if it crashes.<br />
          to start something. anything.<br />
          and not be laughed at for it.</p>

        <p>waffle is for people like us â€”<br />
          misfits who wanted to build but had nowhere to begin.<br />
          who never made it to the "smart group" chat.<br />
          who weren&apos;t top rankers.<br />
          who didn&apos;t just want certificates or placements.<br />
          but wanted something more.<br />
          a tribe.<br />
          a vibe.<br />
          a launchpad.</p>

        <p>launchpad â€” not to Silicon Valley.<br />
          not to the metaverse.<br />
          but to your own voice.</p>

        <p>because maybe you&apos;ve spent years waiting.<br />
          waiting for a mentor.<br />
          waiting for a team.<br />
          waiting for "the right time."<br />
          waiting for permission.<br />
          waiting to be chosen.</p>

        <p>but what if you stop waiting?<br />
          what if you just said:<br />
          <strong>"screw it, i&apos;ll go first."</strong></p>

        <p>waffle is that choice.<br />
          it&apos;s the fuck-it-let&apos;s-build button on your life.<br />
          and you don&apos;t have to do it alone.</p>

        <p>right now, Build with Waffle is nothing fancy.<br />
          we&apos;ve got a Discord group.<br />
          a website that&apos;s half-broken.<br />
          a Notion page full of spelling errors.<br />
          we don&apos;t have sponsors.<br />
          we don&apos;t have clout.<br />
          no swag. no influencers.<br />
          we&apos;re not on TechCrunch.<br />
          we&apos;re not on Shark Tank.<br />
          we don&apos;t have YC badges.<br />
          we don&apos;t have viral TED Talks.<br />
          we only have belief.<br />
          but this belief?<br />
          this belief is loud.<br />
          and it&apos;s spreading.</p>

        <p>we&apos;ve got students from 10+ colleges already jumping in.<br />
          from VIT, Amity, IIIT, Thapar, LPU, UPES, SRM, MNIT, and more.<br />
          students texting us saying:<br />
          "yo, this is the place I&apos;ve been waiting for."</p>

        <p>we&apos;re not promising unicorns.<br />
          we&apos;re not building for valuations.<br />
          we&apos;re building for momentum.<br />
          for your first build.<br />
          your first ship.<br />
          your first "oh damn, i actually did this."</p>

        <p>this is the magic moment:<br />
          when that weird, messy idea in your head finally makes it out into the world.<br />
          when it&apos;s not just "in progress" anymore.<br />
          and whether 1 person sees it or 1,000 â€”<br />
          you&apos;ve moved.</p>

        <p>in the next 30 days, we&apos;re gonna:<br />
          ðŸš€ launch real projects<br />
          ðŸŽ¯ ship messy but meaningful stuff<br />
          âœ¨ showcase student work that never gets applause in classrooms<br />
          ðŸŽ¤ run build nights in hostels and dorm rooms<br />
          ðŸ§  host AMAs with real people â€” not just blue-tick founders<br />
          ðŸ“– tell stories that never make it to LinkedIn<br />
          ðŸŽ¨ bring together coders, creators, designers, writers, filmmakers, misfits â€” all of them</p>

        <p>this isn&apos;t a coding bootcamp.<br />
          this is a creator uprising.<br />
          it&apos;s not just about JavaScript and APIs.<br />
          it&apos;s about ideas.<br />
          it&apos;s about you.</p>

        <p>tech? sure.<br />
          film? yes.<br />
          music? content? writing? fuck yes.</p>

        <p><strong>waffle is the first student-led creator movement in the country<br />
          that doesn&apos;t care what degree you have â€” only what you&apos;re building.</strong></p>

        <p>and look â€”<br />
          we don&apos;t know if this will work.<br />
          we don&apos;t have a roadmap.<br />
          we don&apos;t have an MBA.<br />
          we don&apos;t have a backup plan.<br />
          but for the first time in our lives,<br />
          we are not afraid.<br />
          because we&apos;re not doing this alone.</p>

        <p>we&apos;ve got people who believe just as hard.<br />
          people who show up late at night with wild ideas.<br />
          people who fix bugs at 2 AM because they care.<br />
          people who&apos;ve never been "top of the class,"<br />
          but have always been first to try.</p>

        <p>we&apos;ve got students building waffle chapters in colleges we&apos;ve never even been to.<br />
          we&apos;ve got reels being made before the homepage is ready.<br />
          we&apos;ve got DMs that say:<br />
          "hey, how can I help?"</p>

        <p>and most importantly â€”<br />
          we&apos;ve got you.</p>

        <p>you â€” the one reading this.<br />
          you â€” who might feel like you&apos;re not enough.<br />
          you â€” who&apos;s been waiting to start something, but kept stopping.<br />
          you â€” who still has that spark.</p>

        <p>now&apos;s the time.<br />
          waffle isn&apos;t the answer.<br />
          it&apos;s the question:<br />
          <strong>what will you build if no one stops you?</strong></p>

        <p>this is day zero.<br />
          the day we begin.<br />
          you&apos;ll remember this moment.<br />
          not because it was shiny.<br />
          not because it trended.<br />
          but because something inside you finally clicked.<br />
          you stopped waiting.<br />
          you started moving.</p>
        <p>and together â€”<br />
          we stopped asking for permission<br />
          and started showing the world what students can actually do.</p>
        <p>with love.<br />
          with fire.<br />
          with waffles.<br />
