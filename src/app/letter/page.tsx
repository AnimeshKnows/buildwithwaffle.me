          <p>this is the first message.</p>
          <p>not from a company.</p>
          <p>not from a pitch deck.</p>
          <p>not from a brochure trying to sell you a vision.</p>
          <p>just from us.</p>

          <p>hi.</p>
          <p>welcome to waffle.</p>

          <p>you've probably heard words like "build," "community," "founders," "hackathons," "creators" so many timesâ€¦</p>
          <p>they start to feel like buzzwords.</p>
          <p>they've lost meaning.</p>
          <p>overused in events that promised the moon and delivered pizza.</p>
          <p>plastered on every tech club, every brochure, every event.</p>

          <p>but waffle isn't that.</p>
          <p>waffle isn't trying to be another startup club, or tech gang, or code cult.</p>
          <p>waffle is something raw.</p>
          <p>real.</p>
          <p>personal.</p>

          <p>waffle isâ€¦ the place i always wished existed.</p>
          <p>a space where you don't need to be a genius.</p>
          <p>you don't need to know VC jargon.</p>
          <p>you don't need a co-founder or an elevator pitch.</p>
          <p>you don't need to know what the fuck to do with your life.</p>
          <p>you just need one thing:</p>

          <p><strong>ðŸ’¥ the urge to try.</strong></p>

          <p>the urge to build a dumb project.</p>
          <p>to write that essay you never submitted.</p>
          <p>to drop that YouTube video even if no one watches.</p>
          <p>to design your first Figma screen even if it's ugly.</p>
          <p>to code your first page even if it crashes.</p>
          <p>to start something. anything.</p>
          <p>and not be laughed at for it.</p>

          <p>waffle is for people like us â€”</p>
          <p>misfits who wanted to build but had nowhere to begin.</p>
          <p>who never made it to the "smart group" chat.</p>
          <p>who weren't top rankers.</p>
          <p>who didn't just want certificates or placements.</p>
          <p>but wanted something more.</p>
          <p>a tribe.</p>
          <p>a vibe.</p>
          <p>a launchpad.</p>

          <p>launchpad â€” not to Silicon Valley.</p>
          <p>not to the metaverse.</p>
          <p>but to your own voice.</p>

          <p>because maybe you've spent years waiting.</p>
          <p>waiting for a mentor.</p>
          <p>waiting for a team.</p>
          <p>waiting for "the right time."</p>
          <p>waiting for permission.</p>
          <p>waiting to be chosen.</p>

          <p>but what if you stop waiting?</p>
          <p>what if you just said:</p>
          <p><strong>"screw it, i'll go first."</strong></p>

          <p>waffle is that choice.</p>
          <p>it's the fuck-it-let's-build button on your life.</p>
          <p>and you don't have to do it alone.</p>

          <p>right now, Build with Waffle is nothing fancy.</p>
          <p>we've got a Discord group.</p>
          <p>a website that's half-broken.</p>
          <p>a Notion page full of spelling errors.</p>
          <p>we don't have sponsors.</p>
          <p>we don't have clout.</p>
          <p>no swag. no influencers.</p>
          <p>we're not on TechCrunch.</p>
          <p>we're not on Shark Tank.</p>
          <p>we don't have YC badges.</p>
          <p>we don't have viral TED Talks.</p>
          <p>we only have belief.</p>
          <p>but this belief?</p>
          <p>this belief is loud.</p>
          <p>and it's spreading.</p>

          <p>we've got students from 10+ colleges already jumping in.</p>
          <p>from VIT, Amity, IIIT, Thapar, LPU, UPES, SRM, MNIT, and more.</p>
          <p>students texting us saying:</p>
          <p>"yo, this is the place I've been waiting for."</p>

          <p>we're not promising unicorns.</p>
          <p>we're not building for valuations.</p>
          <p>we're building for momentum.</p>
          <p>for your first build.</p>
          <p>your first ship.</p>
          <p>your first "oh damn, i actually did this."</p>

          <p>this is the magic moment:</p>
          <p>when that weird, messy idea in your head finally makes it out into the world.</p>
          <p>when it's not just "in progress" anymore.</p>
          <p>and whether 1 person sees it or 1,000 â€”</p>
          <p>you've moved.</p>

          <p>in the next 30 days, we're gonna:</p>
          <p>ðŸš€ launch real projects</p>
          <p>ðŸŽ¯ ship messy but meaningful stuff</p>
          <p>âœ¨ showcase student work that never gets applause in classrooms</p>
          <p>ðŸŽ¤ run build nights in hostels and dorm rooms</p>
          <p>ðŸ§  host AMAs with real people â€” not just blue-tick founders</p>
          <p>ðŸ“– tell stories that never make it to LinkedIn</p>
          <p>ðŸŽ¨ bring together coders, creators, designers, writers, filmmakers, misfits â€” all of them</p>

          <p>this isn't a coding bootcamp.</p>
          <p>this is a creator uprising.</p>
          <p>it's not just about JavaScript and APIs.</p>
          <p>it's about ideas.</p>
          <p>it's about you.</p>

          <p>tech? sure.</p>
          <p>film? yes.</p>
          <p>music? content? writing? fuck yes.</p>

        <p><strong>waffle is the first student-led creator movement in the country that doesn't care what degree you have â€” only what you're building.</strong></p>

        <p>and look â€”</p>
        <p>we don't know if this will work.</p>
        <p>we don't have a roadmap.</p>
        <p>we don't have an MBA.</p>
        <p>we don't have a backup plan.</p>
        <p>but for the first time in our lives, we are not afraid.</p>
        <p>because we're not doing this alone.</p>

        <p>we've got people who believe just as hard.</p>
        <p>people who show up late at night with wild ideas.</p>
        <p>people who fix bugs at 2 AM because they care.</p>
        <p>people who've never been "top of the class," but have always been first to try.</p>

        <p>we've got students building waffle chapters in colleges we've never even been to.</p>
        <p>we've got reels being made before the homepage is ready.</p>
        <p>we've got DMs that say: "hey, how can I help?"</p>

        <p>and most importantly â€” we've got you.</p>

        <p>you â€” the one reading this.</p>
        <p>you â€” who might feel like you're not enough.</p>
        <p>you â€” who's been waiting to start something, but kept stopping.</p>
        <p>you â€” who still has that spark.</p>

        <p>now's the time.</p>
        <p>waffle isn't the answer.</p>
        <p>it's the question:</p>
        <p><strong>what will you build if no one stops you?</strong></p>

        <p>this is day zero.</p>
        <p>the day we begin.</p>
        <p>you'll remember this moment.</p>
        <p>not because it was shiny.</p>
        <p>not because it trended.</p>
        <p>but because something inside you finally clicked.</p>
        <p>you stopped waiting.</p>
        <p>you started moving.</p>

        <p>and together â€” we stopped asking for permission and started showing the world what students can actually do.</p>

        <p>with love.</p>
        <p>with fire.</p>
        <p>with waffles.</p>
